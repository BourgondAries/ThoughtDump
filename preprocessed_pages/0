Blog. Turning Off Emotions in Debates.

Whenever a debate comes up I find it incredibly tedious to have to battle the emotions of individuals. I think the emotions - especially the negative ones - are detrimental to the value of discourse: to attain truth. I have hence acknowledged a method (which will be attributed to a close friend of mine) that basically shuts off emotional responses. It will perhaps disengage the intellectually faint or dogmatic individuals.

When the subjects of politics, ethics, religion, etc, come up: perform the following steps with all individuals:
1. Discuss emotions.
2. Ask what the other person thinks about emotions.
3. Hypothesize that emotions are evolutionary adaptations.
4. Hypothesize that emotions are approximations to evolutionary useful decisions.
5. Ask whether emotions are inherently approximations to logical decisions.
6. Does the person disagree?: perhaps we’re wrong and listen. Go back to 2 and keep digging until the person agrees.
7. Does the person agree?: attempt to assert that logical debate is inhibited by emotions being mixed in.

When step 7 is complete you’re in a very safe spot. You can discuss the outermost boundaries of reality without observing [negative] emotional responses. If you do happen to get some of these undesired responses: go back to discussing emotions or close the conversation.

Whether you want to continue discussion or close the conversation after an emotional response is up to you. If you find that spending time on the individual is not beneficial to yourself according to The Law of Survival, then I would suggest disengaging.
