Blog. The Common Survival Misconception.
<br><br>
What I'd like to call out is - and what I think to be - a very common misconception of the phrase: survival of the fittest.
<br><br>
The phrase is normally attributed to by people who have discussions regarding society or politics. I can not help but think that this statement is profoundly ignoring the transitive effects of survival of the fittest. How abstract; examples are often enlightening:
<br><br>
As stated in my post of survival of the superorganism, the state in which a civilization is created and fostered is in itself the result of survival of the fittest. "But you sometimes help others even at the cost of yourself."; may be said. Let's think about that.
<br><br>
When you aid other individuals; are you really being altruistic? Not necessarily. When you aid societal members, you may aid society in itself. Society can then continue to function and reciprocate back to you. When you become a productive or constructive member of a society then you aid that society in becoming a more well-oiled machine which keeps you safe.
<br><br>
Ergo, it is those who are able to communicate. Those able to create pacts. Those able to aid and be aided. Those able to build and maintain a nationstate. I think that those individuals are the fittest. Both as individuals and a collective.
