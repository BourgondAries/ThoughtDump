Blog. The Logical Fallacy of Color.
<p>
A common logical fallacy I encounter during debates on race is the following:
</p>
<p>
“Why does it matter what color your descendants are? Your black ancestors didn’t seem to care.” [Paraphrased from RationalWiki]
</p>

<p>
First of all: the question attempts to strawman the racial discussion by stating that color is the only difference between the races. Proof: we can show that racial differences - although races are not rigidly defined for mammals - are normal reactions or appearances within a population. An example thereof is how different human races react to medicine. Another example is the population’s normal size, body weight, intelligence, etc.

Secondly: the second statement regarding black ancestors not caring is basically a fallacy of composition. Proof: By the same logic we can induce that your bacterial or primordial ancestors didn’t seem to care. Does this in any way validate actions that cause your descendants to be piles of bacteria? Am I attacking a strawman? Some may claim that I do; therefore, I’ll engage the statement directly: Why engage in activities that cause your descendants to be more dissimilar? Under The Law of Survival we must assert that we are superior by surviving as genes. The act of miscegenation will in most cases be having a detrimental effect on the genes. Unless you are otherwise doomed from existence: miscegenation is detrimental.
