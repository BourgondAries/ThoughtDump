Math. Notation.
<br><br>
One thing that has always bothered me is the way mathematical notation is inconsistent in the various sciences. The hurdle of overcoming the specific field's mathematics is often confusing and time-consuming. Here I want to discuss a mathematical notation mostly within calculus that is easy to write, read, and generalize.
