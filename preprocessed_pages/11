From The Law of Survival we can conclude the following list of progenic human priorities. A higher location in the list is allowed to be a detriment of anything lower; however, only if it results in being advantageous from now until eternity. The list is general: it does not include exceptions as disease-ridden family members unworthy of spending resources on.
<br><br>
Yourself.
<br>
Family.
<br>
Friends.
<br>
Group    - Group of those you identify with.
<br>
Ethnicity.
<br>
Race.
<br>
Humans.
<br>
Mammals.
<br>
Plants.
<br>
Eukaryotes.
<br>
Prokaryotes.
<br>
Life.
<br><br>
All of the above are gradients. 'Race' does not signify your own race solely: but first your own. Then somewhat dissimilar ones. Gradually decreasing similarity until we approach 'Humans'.
