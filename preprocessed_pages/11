Blog. Range of Importance.

From The Law of Survival we can conclude the following list of progenic human priorities. A higher location in the list is allowed to be a detriment of anything lower; however, only if it results in being advantageous from now until eternity. The list is general: it does not include exceptions as disease-ridden family members unworthy of spending resources on.

Yourself.

Family.

Friends.

Group    - Group of those you identify with.

Ethnicity.

Race.

Humans.

Mammals.

Plants.

Eukaryotes.

Prokaryotes.

Life.

All of the above are gradients. “Race” does not signify your own race solely: but first your own. Then somewhat dissimilar ones. Gradually decreasing similarity until we approach “Humans”.
