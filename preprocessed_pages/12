Once upon a time there were two tribes of people.
<br><br>
Tribe 'A' was always a small tribe: about 60-90 people. They were farmers.
<br><br>
Tribe 'B' was always a slightly larger tribe: about 130-150 people. They were farmers.
<br><br>
Tribe 'C' was always a small tribe: about 60-90 people. They were farmers. They split off from 'Aâ€™ a while ago.
<br><br>
They were all neighbours. Neither too far nor too close to each other. All tribes are at their breeding limit. Their food supplies always stressed.
<br><br>
One day tribe 'B' attacks 'A'. The tribes are equally armed with pitchforks and other farm equipment. 'B's numerical strength overwhelmes 'A': 'A' is driven to extinction.
<br><br>
'B' has grown to stress both lands food generation: 190-240 people.
<br><br>
'B' has won. 'A' has lost.
<br><br>
'B' was able to create a larger collective. It was able to organize itself into a larger entity. Thereby it also gained the ability to produce more, and affect more. The trait of the superorganism - here - is superiour.
