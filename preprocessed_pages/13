Blog. The Law of Survival.

Once upon a time there was a tribe of people. They enjoyed playing football. When no objects were around, they decapitated the eldest and played football with his head. Have you ever heard of this tribe?

No?
Me neither. Because they almost certainly went extinct. Because their actions were incredibly detrimental to their survival: as both individuals, and a collective.

Now we are here. We have survived. We are still trying to survive. All sane organisms are trying to survive: trying to propagate their genes.

If you do not work toward the goal of propagation; you will die. Your line ends. The ones that survive must by necessity have that goal. They must fulfil that goal.

Hence, we sane organisms are forced to converge towards survival. The law of survival.
