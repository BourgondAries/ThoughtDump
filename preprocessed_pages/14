Blog. What is You?
<br><br>
There is little "you". Life doesn't care about you. It cares about itself. Life is genes. Genes care about themselves. You represent a set of genes...
<br><br>
Genes care only about not going extinct. Not consciously, but via the laws of nature. If a gene causes a person to like those who are similar: those individuals sharing that gene will reciprocally share your fondness of them. Fondness may induce friendship. Friendship may aid a person in attaining progeny.
<br><br>
Hence, the gene has been given aid in spreading itself.
<br><br>
The gene has succeeded.
<br><br>
This is you.
