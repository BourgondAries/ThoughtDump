Blog. Serializing Thoughts.
<br><br>
I think my greatest weakness in regards to writing is that I am unable to sufficiently serialize all my ideas consistently and simultaneously. There is too much information floating around in my head, and it changes too quickly.
<br><br>
I need to figure out how to write in such a way that my thoughts are laid down clearly to the reader.
<br><br>
I find myself daydreaming about writing a text. In the daydream I serialize my thoughts perfectly, but that's because the daydream is of the same speed as my thoughts. I'm not limited by a keyboard.
<br><br>
An idea for writing in a more easily understandable way may be to expose your entire thought repertoire before commenting on the thoughts. I tend to comment on my thoughts without the thoughts being explained properly.
<br><br>
I think I'll review some older posts and word them in a better way.
