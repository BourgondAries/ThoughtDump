Blog. The Law of Survival.
<br><br>
Once upon a time there was a tribe of people. They enjoyed playing football. When no objects were around, they decapitated the eldest and played football with his head. Have you ever heard of this tribe?
<br><br>
No?
<br>
Me neither. Because they almost certainly went extinct. Because their actions were incredibly detrimental to their survival: as both individuals, and a collective.
<br><br>
So what? That overly simple story captures an essential element: a property of us. Now we are here. We have survived. We are still trying to survive. All sane organisms are trying to survive: trying to propagate their genes, and so far we've succeeded.
<br><br>
If you do not work toward the goal of propagation; you will die. Your line ends. The ones that survive must by necessity have that goal. They must fulfil that goal.
<br><br>
Hence, we sane organisms are forced to converge towards survival. This is <strong>the law of survival: evolving entities evolve to survive</strong>.
