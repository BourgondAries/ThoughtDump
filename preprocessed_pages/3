Blog. The Common Survival Misconception.

What I’d like to call out is - and what I think to be - a very common misconception of the phrase: survival of the fittest.

The phrase is normally attributed to by people who have discussions regarding society or politics. I can not help but think that this statement is profoundly ignoring the transitive effects of survival of the fittest. How abstract; examples are often enlightening:

As stated in my post of survival of the superorganism, the state in which a civilization is created and fostered is in itself the result of survival of the fittest. “But you sometimes help others even at the cost of yourself.”; may be said. Let’s think about that.

When you aid other individuals; are you really being altruistic? I do not think this to be true. When you aid societal members, you may aid society in itself. Society can then continue to function. When you become a productive or constructive member of a society then you aid that society in becoming a more well-oiled machine.

Ergo, it is those who are able to communicate. Those able to create pacts. Those able to aid and be aided. Those able to build and maintain a nationstate. I think that those individuals are the fittest. Both as individuals and a collective.
