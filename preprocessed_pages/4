Blog. We're Never Superiour.

Whenever we look up to the mighty but extinct dinosaurs, or the majestic extant lions of Africa: we are somehow touched. A thought that may cross our minds is that we are not in danger of these animals. That we are superiour.

The question of superiority comes up in evolutionary utilitarianism. Is my race superior to - say - the negroid race? Race as it stands is not clearly defined. Neither is life. To avoid the depth of complexity I’ll use species instead. Let’s examine our own genus known as Homo.

Homo includes us: humans. We are the only extant species of homo, and we’re rather successful. As the collective that we are; we have eradicated all threats from predators. With our sophisticated machinery and collective effort we overcome the gravity of this spheroid we’re attached to.

So naturally, people conclude that we’re superior. We’re apex predators. That we’re winning the evolutionary battle. Certainly, this hypothesis seems correct, but we need to examine it a little closer.

Whenever we state that we are superior: we must verify that we are the only living entity from now until forever. No other entity can come into existence. Considering the post about transitive computers: this can simply not be true unless we become the universe. This seems absurd.

There is however one setting in which the statement is valid: We are superior to the extinct entity ‘A’ in this specific juncture in time, and specific location in space.

We are superior to the dinosaurs at this specific time, on earth. They are inferior to us.
We are not superior to lions at this specific time, on earth. They are extant. They continue under our care because their being impresses the human mind. The human mind finds it fascinating. In essence: the lion has become a parasite of our minds. They survive by appealing to human curiosity.

Until something goes extinct: we can not state that we are superior at this specific location and time.
