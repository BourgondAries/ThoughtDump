Blog. Evolutionary Utilitarianism.
<br><br>
<i>We should all agree that each of us is bound to show kindness to his parents and spouse and children, and to other kinsmen in a less degree; and to those who have rendered services to him, and any others whom he may have admitted to his intimacy and called friends; and to neighbours and to fellow-countrymen more than others; and perhaps we may say to those of our own race more than to black or yellow men, and generally to human beings in proportion to their affinity to ourselves.</i>

-Henry Sidgwick, The Methods of Ethics

Evolutionary Utilitarianism is the proposal and refined form of Social Darwinism. It includes more contemporary knowledge about evolution and its workings. For example; it recognizes the gene as the smallest unit of survival instead of the entire entity that encapsulates that gene.

This ethical system is the only one - that I currently know of - that is not dogmatic in nature. It is based upon careful observations. It is defined by utilitarianism - a consequentialistic ethical basis - with the optimization variable being progenic success of the genes.

What was written by Sidgwick can be recognized in my "Range of Importance" post. This is a central tenet. It does not mean that one has to outcompete peers. It implies that good for an individual is simply that; spreading its own genes. This includes aiding those who share similar genes with you. The ethical basis of Evolutionary Utilitarianism is essentially a very mild and non-extreme ethical system. It is self-balanced as it never allows extremes or absolutes (those would potentially be detrimental). This system actually suggests it to be advantageous for an individual to be sociable, analytic, and variable depending on the situation.
