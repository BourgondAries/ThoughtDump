Blog. Ought We Abide?
<br><br>
By The Law of Survival we must always and forever strive to survive. To improve. To outdo the world. But do we really need to?
<br><br>
What if someone wishes to defy it? We already know that those who affirm: will spread. They will be successful, and they will defeat the defiers in the evolutionary struggle for existence. Nature is callous that way. But what if a human being wants to reject The Law of Survival?

I suppose that they are then purely altruistic. Not caring about their own at all. It is imperative for those still abiding by The Law of Survival to mould the deviant. The reason for this is that it can be advantageous to those who are still abiding by the law.

The question of this topic is however; should we abide? The is-ought problem - mostly spoken of in the context of David Hume - comes up quite often. Merely because nature endears those who abide by its laws (a fact) does not mean that one should.

In this particular case, ought is derived from a basis. This means that the basis attempts to reach a goal. The ought therein merely signifies an optimal path. The is merely signifies a fact. However, if the fact is: “Path A is optimal. Therefore, to attain optimal results: one ought to choose path A.”.

Allow me to assert that abiding by evolutionary logic is an optimal strategy for survival. Therefore, to attain optimal progenic potential: one ought to choose this system.

Outside any context of ethical system; the value of ought approaches null. We may choose for ourselves whether to abide by The Law of Survival or not. However; note that those who do not will merely wither away.
