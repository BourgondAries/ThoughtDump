What are emotions? A hypothesis that I find enjoyable to play around with is the following: Emotions are approximations of logical and helpful decisions to the organism at hand. In this case logical and helpful are defined under the context of The Law of Survival. The question that remains is “Why do we require emotions?”.

One such hypothetical answer is that emotions are simply less resource intensive than profoundly contemplating subsequent actions. Verily; I have spent much time (more than a thousand hours) excavating the deepest thoughts: attempting to get answers from my cerebellum. All these hours could probably have been put to something else (perhaps even more productive). A question that arises from the answer of why emotions exist is whether emotions are on their way out of the evolutionary tree.

Society has granted us the luxury of time, space, and safety for contemplation. However, I do not think that emotions are universally going to be eradicated. One hypothesis is that emotions can be controlled by knowledge. It acts as a function that quickly judges a situation according to the individual’s ethical basis. It is incredibly asocial to contemplate during normal social gatherings - humans are not going to spend such an amount of time together; hence, the emotions become a necessity to steer social life.

But what comes beside emotions? I would probably hypothesize that dogmatic or “intuitive” ethical basis are becoming less accurate and helpful. Certainly they must be evolutionary adaptations to an old-civilization environment. Examples of such basis are “Love transcends boundaries”. This statement is not backed up and hence dogmatic.
