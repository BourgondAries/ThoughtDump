Blog. Dogmatic Atheism.

I find no reason; hence, it is good. This is the central tenet of dogmatic atheism. What is it, and how can it be dealt with?

In religions we often find certain dogmas. These are sets of rules, commandments, or prohibitions that set boundaries in life. They are dogmatic simply because they go unquestioned. Dogmas are not critically examined and discarded.

A dogmatic entity may be of either positive or negative survival value within the context of evolutionary utilitarianism. Within atheist circles I have observed certain traits. These traits reflect a rather nihilist and hedonistic style.

An example is atheists positive regard for ethics contrary to religious dogmas such as anti-homosexuality. From my own experience: atheists seem rather fine with it. I think it comes in part from the fact that religious organizations attack such groups. These groups then seek shelter with atheists. Reciprocally; atheists attack these religious organizations.

Alas, the damage* is done. Some atheists have attained dogmatic values. Simply because they can not examine or find answers sufficient to their baseless question “Is it bad?”. In the context of the ethical question posed, atheists often build an ethical basis that resembles humanism. This is also dogmatic.

What is left are polarized groups. Both being dogmatic with their own dogmas. They are both dangerous* because their dogmas are defended viciously. In some cases rebuttal of the dogmas is simply denied. *dangerous from the evolutionary utilitarian point of view with a focus on a society.

Life is a very complex set. If a clear answer is not found then it is not justifying the good or bad of anything. This is what I think fellow atheists should acknowledge.
