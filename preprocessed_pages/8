In contemporary days it appears to be stated as a fact that diversity of biological entities is an objective good. I would like to investigate this claim, or hypothesis.
<br><br>
We can analyse the hypothesis from the perspective of The Law of Survival. At first we may claim that diversity is good (good as in constructive for a gene and its ability to be extant and fertile). When diversity is increased, there will necessarily be an increase in the different genes and their orderings thereof. I suppose this may cause the local cluster of individuals to be in a competition. Eventually there will be distinct races of individuals that express and assert their own superiority due to The Law of Survival.

Miscegenation may yield offspring that have subsets of both gene pools. These interbred individuals may (hybrid vigor) or may not (genetic outbreeding) have a higher fitness value and cause genetic drift to occur (if the population is sufficiently small).
<br><br>
The act of miscegenation will presumably have detrimental effects on your genetic lineage according to The Law of Survival. Unless of course your race was already doomed to start with. Then it is beneficial because the new entities (mixed offspring) still resemble you - to a lesser degree. Both pools will contain an overwhelming majority of the same genes. It can be a win or a loss depending on the case. This is observed from one individual belonging to a race in the population.

We can also analyze the perspective of a biologist. Mixing different strains or races may more quickly yield different offspring; hence, also the ability for evolution to select for certain traits more quickly. That is interesting if we wish to create a better set of individuals for our own purpose.

Finally we can look at emotivism. It appears some people are emotional. Some will attribute good to diversity. Under such an ethical system diversity is good via democratic vote. It is however an ethical basis that I would like to analyse a little closer. First off all I observe that emotivism may be the result of our evolutionary path. I suspect the current emotional balance in humans is such that some individuals may not be able to identify the dangers associated with individuals of vastly different races that are able to outbreed and replace them. The individuals have - what I suppose are - Evolutionary Artifacts. These were once beneficial traits that are still in a population but currently quite detrimental. I guess I'll post about the idea at some later point in time.

Essentially: diversity is positive or detrimental for a gene or a set thereof depending entirely on context.
