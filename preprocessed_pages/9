Blog. Computers and Transitivity.
<br><br>
After a discussion with a friend of mine it has come to my attention that the ethical basis of darwinian utilitiarianism can be expanded and generalized quite easily to the domain of all that exists.
<br><br>
When applying The Law of Survival to hyrogen atoms, sucrose molecules, or computers: it all holds up. Hydrogen atoms are successful, but they are going extinct. They are burned by stars because stars want to multiply (they do not have an actual consciousness of course, but this is what the natural laws cause). The large stars create iron. Others create only helium. These elements will probably become more dominant in distant futures.
<br><br>
Sucrose molecules are more alike our DNA. In fact, our DNA is consists in part of a 5-sugar known as 2-deoxyribose. Whilst sucrose is not used in our DNA, it still holds properties - as DNA does - that allows it to spread and replicate. It is precisely this that defines what is successful or not under The Law of Survival.

Computers are not natural molecules or natural substances. In fact, the word 'natural' basically means 'All that is non-human.'. A very anthropocentric word indeed. But letâ€™s not get caught up in those semantics for the sake of this example: Computers are useful to humans. They are able to spread because we and our desires require them. It is just like how plants and their desires require sucrose. As the stars require the production of helium and other base elements for nuclear fusion. All of these are subsystems that have requirements. The universe and its laws can be considered the root of the system. It is the system.
<br><br>
We humans are merely such a subsystem, and within this subsystem other systems can attempt to survive and spread. Computers, requested by humans. Humans, requested by nature. Transitivity leads us to conclude that computers are requested* by nature: the universe. (* requesting in this context: I'm thinking of it being a necessity of nature to eventually produce these entities.)
